Here I have written the logic of how I would try to solve the part 1 .But I could not complete.

first initialize total four lists to store x and y co ordinates for the two trees.
then generate a random number on the image.
find nearest node on tree to the random point
get the new node and check if the path intersects a obstacle
in a circle of radius of value defined by us and new node as centre , check he nodes in the search radius for shorter path to the new node and update
our list of distances from the start to the new node.
join the two nodes on both trees which give the shortest distance to the final point.
